---
## Instructions

Clone this lab inside of your homework folder. Once finished, be sure to create a pull request.

## Intro

The Intro to Express lesson, with all of that new information, can be mind-blowing for sure.

It's natural, in fact, **expected**, to feel "uncomfortable" and confused by Node.js & Express at this point.

As always, the journey toward competence requires practice - so let's get on with it!

## Exercise

The goal of the exercise is to put in a rep doing everything that you did during the Into to Express lesson!

However, instead of To Dos, change up the data resource to something else, like `students` - your call.

### This lab is a deliverable
